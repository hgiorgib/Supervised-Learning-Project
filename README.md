# Flight Prediction Project

## Objectives
To create a model to predict arrival delay for flights for the first week of January 2020.

&nbsp;
## Process
### Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Cleaning
* Data Exploration 
* Visualisations for data
* Feature engineering

### Modelling
* Data Scaling for certain models
* PCA for certain models
* Hyperparameter tuning --> GridSearch
* Models tested
    * Linear Regression
    * Ridge Regression
    * Lasso regression
    * Random Forest
    * XGBoost

&nbsp;
## Results
The final model we settled on was the Random Forest model with an r2 score of: 0.11992
